[Draft 0.3]
Started by Lucas Garron, December 07, 2011

## Summary

- The WCA Regulations Committee (WRC) will have about two to three members. They are assisted by any number of official advisors.
- The WRC is responsible for maintaining three documents:
  - The WCA Regulations - concise, normative rules
  - The WCA Guidelines - detailed suggestions and clarifications for interpreting the Regulations
  - The WCA Incidents Log - a list of all regulation-related incidents that occur.
- The WRC should take input from the cubing community in submitting proposals to the WCA. The WCA may approve updates to the Regulations and/or Guidelines at any time, although the Regulations should have one major update every year.

## Full Wording

      iii. The WCA board has the exclusive ability to appoint and remove WRC members. Any changes in membership must be publicly announced.
      iv. The WRC may reserve the right to discuss any matters in private, but should be open about its proceedings whenever possible. In particular, yearly revisions to the regulations must be an open process.
  c. WRC Advisors
      i. Role: WRC advisors have the responsibility to help the WRC draft parts of of regulation proposal in conjunction with community feedback.
      ii. WRC advisors are not members of the WRC and have no nominal power. However, the WRC may delegate any of its responsibilities to a WRC advisor for a particular case (e.g. drafting part of a proposal, privately reviewing and announcing an incident, etc.).
      iii. Recommended Qualities: WRC advisors should have enough of the recommended qualities for WRC members to be able to contribute to the relevant parts of the process.
      iv. The WRC has the responsibility to manage its advisors, under supervision of the WCA board. WRC advisors may be brought on for any length of time, and any new members must be documented publicly.

    i. The WRC is responsible for making these documents easily accessible to the public, and keeping them up to date.
  b. Official WCA Regulations
    i. The WCA Regulations must contain all normative rules about the WCA and its competitions. (e.g. what *must* be done and what *must not* be done)
    ii. Any revisions to the Regulations must be submitted to the WCA board as a proposal from the WRC.

    iii. The structure of the guidelines should mirror the structure of the regulations, with cross-references.
    iv. While the Regulations should attempt to set rules to be followed “in spirit”, the Guidelines should clarify details about interpretation of the regulations “to the letter”. This is intended to make the Regulations concise while maintaining a complete sets of   rules that can be implemented consistently around the world.
    v. While the guidelines are still considered official rules, they should be considered less constant. The WRC should not hesitate to propose frequent changes to the Guidelines.

      2. Any regulations that use the word “should”.

    iii. The WRC alone has full power and responsibility to add an entry to the incident log.

    iv. Any important incidents in the log may be accompanied by an official announcement about the incident by a WCA board or WRC member, along with descriptions of the incident with its circumstances and resolutions.
    v. Wherever an incident or is a significant precedent / example for similar rulings, the Guidelines should also be revised with a proposal covering new clarifications and a reference to relevant incident.

  1. Proposals may be submitted at any time.
  2. If there are independent changes to be proposed, multiple proposals may be submitted at once.

    iii. The WCA board has the exclusive right to approve or reject a proposal.
      1. The WCA board must either approve a proposal in its entirety, or reject it in its entirety. This is intended to prevent “line-item” approval.
      2. The WCA board should make its decision in a reasonable amount of time. Any upcoming competitions that may be affected by the proposal should be taken into account when taking time to make a decision.
      3. If the WCA board has concerns about any part of a proposal, they may reject the proposal and request additional changes to be incorporated into a modified proposal.
      4. Updates may be made to the Regulations at any time, although it is recommended that this is only done during the yearly proposal. If there any important *clarifications* during the year, they should be added to the Guidelines. It is recommended that any other *corrections, deletions, or additions* to the Regulations be limited to textual revisions.
      5. Updates to the Guidelines may be made with any frequency. It is recommended that any important regulation-related incidents are used to incorporate a clarification to the guidelines, along with a reference to the incident.
4. Communication
  a. The WCA shall set up a forum where members of the WRC advisors can discuss details about implementing regulation changes. It is recommended that only WRC advisors can post in the forum, but that records of the discussions be available to the public for   accountability.
  b. The WCA board may communicate with the WRC chairs via email. The WRC and the WCA must inform each other of *any* incidents or exceptions to the regulations. For example, if the WCA would like to grant an exception to the Regulations for a competition, the WRC   *must* be informed.
  c. The WRC and its advisors are responsible for staying in communication with the general cubing community. Regulations should be drafted according to community consensus.
    i. The WCA Regulations subforum at http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=4&sid=20e24ad3327d66cbaf2888c24e6cf7c4 should be considered the official place where any regulation issues are discussed. All posts in the official WCA Regulations subforum *must* be given consideration by the WRC.
    ii. Other forums like http://www.speedsolving.com/forum/ or the other WCA subforums (like “WCA Competitions”) may be used for community discussion. However, community members should note that *only posts in the official WCA Regulations subforum are guaranteed to be  given full consideration*, although other online conversations may be cited in the official forum  to provide evidence for community consensus.
  d. The WCA shall have an email address, regulations@worldcubeassociation.org, that forwards to all the WRC members. In addition to posting in forums, any community member should be welcome to use this email to bring something to the attention of the WRC.

## Revisions:
0.2: There are only 2-3 WRC members now; everyone else is an advisor. This clarifies roles and responsibilities for the WRC, and it is consistent with the number of WCA board “members”.
0.3: Small changes and conversion to text format.
