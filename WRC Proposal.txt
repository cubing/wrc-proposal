## Revisions:
0.2: There are only 2-3 WRC members now; everyone else is an advisor. This clarifies roles and responsibilities for the WRC, and it is consistent with the number of WCA Board “members”.
0.3: Small changes and conversion to text format.
0.4: Addition of provisions for scramblers.
0.5: Advisors removed, because the status is not really necessary for providing feedback.
0.6: A lot.
0.7: Added Constitution, merged Competition Regulations and Guidelines.
