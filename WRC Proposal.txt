    2d4) Requirements for Official Scramblers:
      2d4a) Official scramblers must generate random-state scrambles for all puzzles for which this is practical. Where this is impractical, the scramblers must provide a sufficient degree of randomness that is fair to all competitors at all competitions.

      2d4c) Official scramblers must make a reasonable effort to prevent anyone else from obtaining the generated scrambles.
      2d4d) Official scramblers should make it easy for anyone to generate official scrambles on their computer with reasonable time and effort.

      2d4f) Official scramblers should produce scrambles that are easy to archive and publish in a digital format (e.g. plain text version copies of the scrambles, or PDF files of scramble printouts).
      2d4g) Official scramblers should be able to run offline.
    2d5) Official versions of the scramblers must be available for use/download directly from the WRC. Official competitions must be required to use current official versions of the scramblers, even if other variants are available.
  2e) Official WCA Incidents Log

    2e3) The WRC alone has full power and responsibility to add an entry to the incident log.
      2e2a) All significant WCA incidents *must* be recorded in the incident log by the WRC.
      2e2b) The WCA Board or the IAC may advise the WRC to withhold certain information to the incident to the log. However, the WRC has the ultimate responsibility to bring any important incidents to the attention of affected cubers and the general community.
      2e2c) The WRC has the discretion to limit the extent of the information published in the log (e.g. names and any sensitive details that are not necessary to help others learn from the incident).

3) Responsibilities
  3a) Amendments

      3a1a) Amendments may be submitted at any time.
      3a1b) If there are independent changes to be proposed, multiple amendments may be submitted at once.
      3a1c) Each individual change in an amendment should be supported by an explanation with any links and citations of community discussion that demonstrate community consikeaensus for the change. Any controversial changes should be clearly justified.
      3a1d) Any change to any content of the Regulations, Guidelines, or Scramblers requires an amendment to be submitted by the WRC and approved by the WCA Board.
    3b2) The WRC’s main responsibility is to submit a yearly amendment for updates to the official WCA Regulations and Guidelines. This should be completed by the end of a calendar year and come into effect January 1.
      3b2a) The yearly amendment may be accompanied by additional, independent amendments (e.g. an amendment for a new event that the WCA Board may or not approve, independently of the main amendment).
      3b2b) The WCA Board has the exclusive right to approve or reject an amendment. The WCA Board must either approve an amendment in its entirety, or reject it in its entirety. This is intended to prevent “line-item” approval. If the WCA Board has concerns about any part of an amendment, it may reject the amendment and request additional changes to be incorporated into a modified amendment.
      3b2c) The WCA Board should make its decision in a reasonable amount of time. Any upcoming competitions that may be affected by the amendment should be taken into account when taking time to make a decision
      3b2d) Updates may be made to the Regulations at any time, although it is recommended that this only be done during the yearly amendment. If there any important *clarifications* during the year, they should be added to the Guidelines. Any other *corrections, deletions, or additions* to the Regulations should be limited to important textual revisions.
      3b2e) Updates to the Guidelines may be made with any frequency. Any important regulation-related incidents should incorporate a clarification to the guidelines, along with a reference to the incident.
4) Communication
  4a) Transparency: The WRC should carry out its major responsibilities in an open process that involves feedback from the international community.
  4b) The WRC and the WCA must inform each other of *any* incidents or exceptions to the regulations. For example, if the WCA would like to grant an exception to the Regulations for a competition, the WRC *must* be informed.
  4c) The WRC is responsible for staying in communication with the general cubing community. Amendments should be drafted according to community consensus, and the WRC should make an effort to communicate with WCA delegates to take into account the concerns and ideas of cubers from all regions.
  4d) The WCA shall maintain an online WCA Regulations Forum (currently at http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=4 as of December 2011) as the official place where any regulation issues are discussed. All posts in the official WCA Regulations subforum *must* be given consideration by the WRC.
  4e) The WCA shall have an email address, regulations@worldcubeassociation.org, that forwards to all the WRC members. In addition to posting in the official forum, any community member should be welcome to use this email to bring something to the attention of the WRC.

## Revisions:
0.2: There are only 2-3 WRC members now; everyone else is an advisor. This clarifies roles and responsibilities for the WRC, and it is consistent with the number of WCA Board “members”.
0.3: Small changes and conversion to text format.
0.4: Addition of provisions for scramblers.
0.5: Advisors removed, because the status is not really necessary for providing feedback.
